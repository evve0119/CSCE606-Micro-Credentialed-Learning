The client directory is for react and the server directory is for express. \
To run the project, the first step is to run `npm install` under client directory and under server directory to install all the dependencies.
Then, run `npm start` under client directory to execute react and run `npm start` under server directory to execute express.

<h3> Remark </h3>

`.env` file will no longer be update on github to protect account. \
Please make sure that you ask for the latest `.env` in the group. Thank you!

<h3> How to run the application <h3>
<b>MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN server FILE!</b>

`cd app/server`

<h4>Using two localhosts localhost:8080 for server and localhost:3000 for React frontend</h4>
<h5> For the backend server </h5>

`cd app/server/`\
`npm install`\
`nodemon server.js` or `npm start` whichever works\
The server will run on localhost:8080

<h5> For the Frontend </h5>
Open the other terminal

`cd app/server/client`\
`npm install`\
`npm start`\
React will run on localhost:3000

Executing the above will launch the app on localhost

<h3> Deploying on Heroku: </h3>
<h4>Step 1:  Change React frontend to static file and use localhost:8080 for server</h4>
Instead of having two hosts, change react to static file, we only need one for the server

Go to `app/server/.env` change `NODE_ENV = production`

Go to `app/server/client/scr/services` and change all files of "API_URL" to get rid of localhost:3000

<h5> For the Frontend </h5>

`cd app/server/client`\
`npm run build`\
React become static file

<h5> For the backend server </h5>

`cd app/server`\
`nodemon server.js`\
The server will run on localhost:8080

<h4>Step 2:  Push entire app on Heroku</h4>
<b>MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN server FILE!</b>

Put `.env` to gitignore

`cd app/server`\
`heroku login`\
`git init`\
`heroku git:remote -a micro-credential-learning`\
`git add .`\
`git commit -am "<message>"`\
`git push heroku master`

<h3> Update application on Heroku: </h3>
To test the app and deploy on Heroku
<b>MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN server FILE!</b>

`cd app/server`

<h4>Step 1: Login to Heroku and clone the repository</h4>

`heroku login`\
`heroku git:clone -a micro-credential-learning`

<h4>Step 2: Clone the repository on github and copy all the file to Heroku repository</h4>

Clone the repository on github `git clone git@github.com:evve0119/CSCE606-Micro-Credentialed-Learning.git`

Copy all the file from `CSCE606-Micro-Credentialed-Learning/app/server` to `micro-credential`

Go to `micro-credential/.env` change `NODE_ENV = production`

Go to `micro-credential/client/scr/services` and change all files of "API_URL" to get rid of localhost:3000

<h4>Step 3:  Push entire app on Heroku</h4>
<b>MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN server FILE!</b>

Put `.env` to gitignore

`cd micro-credential-learning`\
`git add .`\
`git commit -am "<message>"`\
`git push heroku master`

<h3> To run cucumber tests: </h3>

In order to run the cucumber tests, you will need to install a chrome browser into your PATH, since the cucumber tests use selenium to check if the frontend responds as what we expect.
1. As usual, switch directory into app/server, and `npm install`, this should automatically install selenium.
2. Go to this website http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html and choose a chrome version that matches your current chrome version. In my terminal, I am using version 106.0.5249.21 on my M1 Mac.
3. Download the file that matches your operating system, and add the chromedriver.exe to your path (for Mac users, go to /usr/local/bin, and drag the file into that folder).
4. Then you are ready to run selenium.
5. If an error pops out when running cucumber saying that â€œchromedriver cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified", you need to move the chrome driver out of quarantine by typing in the terminal `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/chromedriver`.

`npm test` this will execute the cucumber tests.

If you are using macOS or Linux, you will see a "permission denied" error when executing `npm test`. \
You will need to give permission to the path by typing: \
`sudo chmod 755 <path in the error message>`, \
and then `npm test` will be able to function correctly.

<h3> To run jest (unit test): </h3>

`npm run jest` this will execute the unit test\
Please open mongod before unit test.
